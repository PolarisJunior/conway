<p class="">Conway's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life"><em
            class="teal-text text-accent-1">Game of Life</em></a> is a popular cellular automaton created by
    mathematician John Horton Conway.
    With only a handful of
    simple rules, it can yield amazingly complex emergent behavior. Game of Life is governed
    by the following four rules:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <ol>
        <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.</li>
        <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
        <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
        <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
        </li>
    </ol>
</blockquote>
